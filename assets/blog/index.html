    <h1>Introducing Numbat</h1>

    <p>Numbat is a programming language with a type system that treats <em>physical dimensions</em> as types.
    The type checker infers types for every expression in the program and ensures that everything is correct in terms of physical dimensions &mdash; and therefore also correct in terms of units.
    For example, the expression <code><span class="numbat-value">3</span> <span class="numbat-unit">months</span></code> has a <em>type</em> of <code class="numbat-type-identifier">Time</code>.
    The expression <code><span class="numbat-value">2</span> <span class="numbat-unit">years</span></code> also has a type of <code class="numbat-type-identifier">Time</code>.
    The compound expression <code><span class="numbat-value">3</span> <span class="numbat-unit">months</span> + <span class="numbat-value">2</span> <span class="numbat-unit">years</span></code> is therefore well-typed.<br>
    On the other hand, <code><span class="numbat-value">3</span> <span class="numbat-unit">months</span> + <span class="numbat-value">2</span> <span class="numbat-unit">lightyears</span></code> is <em>ill</em>-typed, because the right-hand side is of type <code class="numbat-type-identifier">Length</code>. Try to change <code class="numbat-unit">years</code> to <code class="numbat-unit">lightyears</code> in the example below to see the resulting compiler error:

    <div id="editor1" class="code-editor">3 months + 2 years</div>
    <pre id="output1" class="numbat-output"></pre>

    <p>
    Basing the type system on physical <em>dimensions</em> instead of physical <em>units</em> has a few advantages. For one, we do not have to change type annotations when switching units.

    <div id="editor2" class="code-editor">let pendulum_length = 30 cm
let t_oscillation = 2 pi sqrt(pendulum_length / g0)

print("Oscillation period: {t_oscillation}")</div>
    <pre id="output2" class="numbat-output"></pre>


<p>The following program calculates and prints the flow rate in a pipe
using the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. It assumes the dynamic
viscosity of water and allows for inputs of pipe radius,
pipe length, and pressure difference.</p>

    <div id="editor3" class="code-editor">let μ_water: DynamicViscosity = 1 mPa·s

fn flow_rate(radius: Length, length: Length, Δp: Pressure) -&gt; FlowRate =
    π × radius^4 × Δp / (8 μ_water × length)

let pipe_radius = 1 cm
let pipe_length = 10 m
let Δp = 0.1 bar

let q = flow_rate(pipe_radius, pipe_length, Δp)

q × 30 min -&gt; l</div>
    <pre id="output3" class="numbat-output"></pre>

    <p>
        Numbat is open source. It is available both as a cross platform command-line application
        as well as a web version (<a href="https://numbat.dev">http://numbat.dev</a>).
